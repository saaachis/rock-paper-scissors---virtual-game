This project implements a novel twist on the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, leveraging the power of computer vision for an interactive experience. Instead of using traditional buttons or touchscreens for player input, the system utilizes a camera to track hand gestures. The player throws a rock, paper, or scissors with their hand, and the computer vision system analyzes the captured image to identify the chosen move.

On the other hand, the computer opponent's move is randomly generated by the program.  The game then compares the player's move to the computer's, determining the winner based on the classic Rock Paper Scissors rules. 

This innovative approach eliminates the need for physical buttons and creates a more engaging and immersive gameplay experience.
